\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisors Sune Lehmann Jørgensen, Jakob Eg Larsen, and Vedran Sekara for their guidance and feed-back. Additionally, I would like to thank Arek Stopczynski for his help with the database, and Piotr Sapieżyński and Ole Winther for their help with inferring methods. A big thank you the the volunteers, who bore the brunt of the data gathering: Rafaela-Ioana Voiculescu, Magdalena Furman and Ferdinando Papale. Also a big thank you to Mathias Blicher Bjerregård for his help with the abstract translation.
