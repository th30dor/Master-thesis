\chapter{Summary (English)}

The goal of the thesis is to provide a method which infers the existence of physical co-location based on Bluetooth RSSI measurements. We gather two types of data through the use of mobile phones, which then we merge in a single set. We use the resulting set to analyse three algorithms: artificial neural networks, logistic regression and Naive Bayes. We vary the parameters of the algorithms and the features used and we compare the results. We look at how well the algorithms can infer co-location, as well as how computationally expensive they are. We finish this paper by recommending the combination of algorithm and feature that had the best results.
